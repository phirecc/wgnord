# wgnord
This script lets you connect to NordVPN servers through WireGuard using their "NordLynx" protocol.

```
Usage: wgnord [ l(ogin) | c(onnect) | d(isconnect) | a(ccount) ]

login:
    wgnord l "your_token"
    You can generate a (permament) token in the NordVPN dashboard
connect:
    wgnord c france
    -f            Refresh cached longitude/latitude
    -n            Don't connect
    -o out.conf   Write config to different file
disconnect:
    wgnord d
account:
    wgnord a
    Prints information about the currently logged in account

wgnord's files are in /var/lib/wgnord, edit template.conf to change Wireguard options
```

## Installation

Dependencies: 

- jq
- curl
- wg-quick (wireguard-tools)
- openresolv (for dns)

To install them on Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S --needed jq curl wireguard-tools openresolv
```

Manual installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/phirecc/wgnord
cd wgnord
install -Dm644 template.conf /var/lib/wgnord/template.conf
install -Dm644 countries.txt /var/lib/wgnord/countries.txt
install -Dm644 countries_iso31662.txt /var/lib/wgnord/countries_iso31662.txt
install -Dm644 hostname_ids.txt /var/lib/wgnord/hostname_ids.txt
sudo install -Dm755 wgnord /usr/bin/wgnord
```

`wgnord` can also be installed through the AUR like so:
```
paru -S wgnord
```

## Usage
Login (you only need to do this once):
```
sudo wgnord l "your_token"
```

You can generate a (permament) token in the NordVPN dashboard under `Access token > Generate new
token`

Now you can connect to a server:
```
sudo wgnord c France
```

Note: country names are case-insensitive and grepped for, so `sudo wgnord c fra` would work aswell. See `countries.txt` for a list of available countries.

To disconnect:
```
sudo wgnord d
```

If you want to change WireGuard config parameters (MTU, DNS, etc.), simply modify `/var/lib/wgnord/template.conf`.

## Extra
This script includes a "kill-switch" because of the way wg-quick works. Connections will typically stay alive for multiple days, but if it dies you can reconnect by running another connect command.

## Note
This third-party project is in no way affiliated with NordVPN.
